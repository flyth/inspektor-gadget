# Grouping

If you have an array of your struct, you can group it by one or more columns. This will reduce the number of entries to
the number of distinct values for the columns you group by. By default, the values of the first entry belonging to a
group will be used, however, you can specify the `group` attribute to add up the values of a given
field.

Other grouping functions may follow as needed.
